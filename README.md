## Athena Researcher üê®

* A tool to assist you with your research, initially designed for students built on EXA AI and Huggingface Gradio 
* ExA.ai is a cutting-edge platform that specializes in natural language processing (NLP) and data extraction. Its ability to process unstructured data and extract meaningful information made it an ideal choice for Athena. With ExA.ai, I could easily parse academic papers, articles, and other text-based resources to extract key insights.
* ## Building Athena: The Process

### Step 1: Setting Up the Environment
I started by setting up the development environment using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The entire project is hosted on GitHub, and you can find the repository [here](https://github.com/uzeziogho/Athena/blob/main/Athena.ipynb). The notebook contains all the code and step-by-step instructions for replicating the tool.

### Step 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing
Using ExA.ai, I automated the process of collecting data from various sources, including academic journals, news articles, and online databases. ExA.ai‚Äôs NLP capabilities allowed me to preprocess the data by removing noise, tokenizing text, and extracting relevant entities.

### Step 3: Data Analysis with DeepSeek
Once the data was preprocessed, I used DeepSeek to perform advanced analysis. This included:
- **Topic Modeling**: Identifying key themes and trends in the data.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Gauging the sentiment of textual content.
- **Insight Generation**: Creating summaries and actionable insights.

### Step 4: Building the User Interface
To make Athena user-friendly, I integrated it with a simple web interface using Flask. This allowed users to input their research queries and receive results in an easy-to-understand format.

### Step 5: Testing and Optimization
After building the initial version, I tested Athena on various datasets to ensure accuracy and efficiency. I also optimized the code to improve performance and reduce processing time.
